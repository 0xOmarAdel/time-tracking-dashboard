# Time Tracking Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a time tracking dashboard based on the provided design and requirements. The project utilizes React.js with TypeScript for the frontend, SASS for styling, and Axios for handling API requests. The data for the cards is fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products?limit=10) using the GET list request.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xOmarAdel/time-tracking-dashboard.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd time-tracking-dashboard
npm install
```

3. Run the project:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the dashboard in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **SASS:** CSS extension language for more maintainable and organized styles.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Design

The header (navbar) design for the dashboard has been created and can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/UsF6jByMG1WK84pOJSaQfM/Luftborn?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=mmliINrVf0EkdeRg-0).
